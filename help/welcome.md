Web application for the LVP project
=======================
Web app containing the ressources developped by the LVP project. This encompasses the following: 

## Treaty transcription and translation
The historical sources relating to smallsword fencing (i.e. historical foil fencing) are transcribes and/or translated to be studied in order to better understand the intricacies of the different methods developped across the ages.  
Currently, work is being carried out on 17th century texts from several places in Europe, including France, the British Isles, Germany and the Netherlands.


## LVP Database
Seeing as there is little work done on the subject of smallswords as items, the LVP-DB was started by retrieving militaria objects from the internet and classifying them to extract as much observable information as possible from them. Although it is not restricted to smallswords, and that it contains a majority of non-smallsword items, the focus is mainly on smallswords. This means that most utilities will be geared towards smallswords although the other items can still be viewed.  
On of the goals of the LVP project is to create a classification of smallswords based on their observable features. To this end, an ontology was created to describe smallswords and each smallsword in the database is subjected to it. This not only helps to better understand these weapons and their design, but also would enable their classification and dating according to these features, discovering the different types or trends that smallswords follow, and also detecting swords resulting of a combination of unrelated subparts.
